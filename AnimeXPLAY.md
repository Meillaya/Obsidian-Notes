### Credits

Any content in AniMixPlay was taken from another websites, therefore you should still be able to find the same content in original sites where we scrape it from below :

\*Websites listed below are NOT affiliated with us, we just use their public services or scrape their content.

### User Data Export

You can export your animixplay account data (watchlist, ep progress, etc) to other places like myanimelist.net . Here is how :  

1\. Download your animixplay data here (XML).  
2\. Create new [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/register.php) account.  
3\. Open MyAnimeList [Import page](https://myanimelist.net/import.php). (please use new account! it will overwrite your existing list)  
4\. Choose import type : MyAnimeList Import.  
5\. Select the XML file then click 'Import Data'.  
6\. Wait few sec and done.  

You can then move your data from MAL to another place. MAL is a popular website, so a lot of services already have integration.

You could also export to another format (JSON) if you want read the file with text viewer.

### Preserved archive

You still can login to your account [here](https://animixplay.to/user/recover) to view your account for the last time. It's just for archival, so you can't watch anime or anything useful, but you can manage your account like deleting it forever.

We will keep this domain, archive, and data export running as long as possible.

### Why shutdown the site?

Scraping another website requires constant maintenance, any structure changes or protection measures on another site can break our system. Every time we make a workaround to fix, it add additional mess. Now the scrapper already so messy that this problem might need a total rework to fix it. We are not motivated to do this. Our service quality is already keep getting worse that we feel it would be better if the site just shut down and people went somewhere better. Letting the site half-working using existing iframe streams is just not acceptable.  
We are just scraping other websites anyway. There are a lot of other apps and websites that do the same. Besides, you can still just go directly to the original sites where we get all of the contents, be it wiki sites where info is maintained, legal services where anime is originally licensed, or another pirate sites where we get their streams (all sites in credits).

### What next?

Thank you for all the support, but AniMixPlay is no longer exist in any form, forever. If you found anything that says otherwise, it's false and probably just gives you copycat website that uses our brand to gain attention. Please don't use them. Just move on, we won't come back.

We have no problem with other people who want to recreate our website, but please create your own brand name and don't pretend to be us.
