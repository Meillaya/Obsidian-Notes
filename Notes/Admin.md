Don’t even ask the question. The answer is always leetcode. Asking if your TC is high enough? Who cares, do leetcode and it will be higher. Worrying about the housing bubble in the Bay Area? Stop worrying; grind leetcode. Leetcode is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Albertsons engineers programmed your very existence as an LC easy with editorial, decades ago. Any question you can think of, the answer is most certainly leetcode, even the questions you aren’t thinking of - or the ones you will never even think of. Leetcode. You have no original thoughts. Free will is a myth. Leetcode sees all, knows all, and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe. So please before you make a post about FAANG or prestige, think again.
