The language generated by G:
Based on the productions you provided, the grammar G can generate the language L(G) consisting of all strings of the form:

w = u$v$

where $u$ and $v$ are strings over the alphabet {a, b} such that $u$ and $v$ have the same number of a's and b's, and $v$ is a suffix of $u$.

In other words, the language generated by the grammar G is the set of all strings that can be split into two parts, the first part containing an equal number of a's and b's, and the second part being a suffix of the first part.

Here is a more detailed explanation of how the productions generate strings in L(G):

Starting from the start symbol S, we can generate any string in L(G) by applying the following rule:
S → X$

This rule adds the end-marker symbol $ to the end of the string, indicating the end of the first part of the string.

The rule X → ε allows us to generate the empty string, which is a valid string in L(G) since it has an equal number of a's and b's.

The rules X → aXA and X → bXB allow us to add an a or b to the first part of the string while maintaining the balance of a's and b's. Specifically, the rules generate a non-terminal symbol A or B, which in turn generate a substring that contains one more a or b than the other. This process can be repeated any number of times to generate any string in L(G).

The rules Aa → aA and Ab → bA allow us to generate any substring with an equal number of a's and b's by replacing a's with a non-terminal A symbol, and similarly for the rules Ba → aB and Bb → bB. This process can be repeated any number of times to generate any string in L(G).

Finally, the rules A$ → a$ and B$ → b$ allow us to add the end-marker symbol $ to the end of the first part of the string, which completes the generation of the entire string in L(G).

The rule $ → ε allows us to generate the empty string, which is necessary to satisfy the requirement that the second part of the string be a suffix of the first part.

In other words, the language generated by G consists of all strings that can be split into two parts: the first part (u) contains an equal number of a's and b's, and the second part (v) is a suffix of the first part. For example, some strings in the language are:

ab$ (u=ab, v=$)
aabb$ (u=aabb, v=$)
bbaaa$ (u=bbaaa, v=$)
aabbaabbaabb$ (u=aabbaabbaabb, v=$)
Note that the empty string is also included in the language since it satisfies the conditions for u and v. However, any string that does not satisfy the conditions is not in the language. For example, the string "aabbb" is not in the language since it has more a's than b's.



Yes, we can construct a recursive-descent parser for the given grammar G. A recursive-descent parser is a type of top-down parser that starts from the start symbol and recursively expands non-terminals until it reaches the input string. The parser maintains a lookahead pointer to the current input symbol and selects the appropriate production to apply based on the current non-terminal and the lookahead symbol.

To construct a recursive-descent parser for G, we need to write a function for each non-terminal symbol that generates the corresponding set of strings in the language. Here is a brief description of the functions for each non-terminal:

S(): This function generates the set of strings that start with the non-terminal X and end with the end-marker symbol `$`. We can call the X() function and check that the lookahead symbol is $.

X(): This function generates the set of strings that can be split into two parts: the first part (u) contains an equal number of a's and b's, and the second part (v) is a suffix of the first part. We can call the A() or B() function to generate the first part, and then recursively call the X() function to generate the second part. We can check that the second part is a suffix of the first part by comparing the remaining input symbols with the generated suffix.

A(): This function generates the set of strings that have an equal number of a's and b's, and start with one or more a's. We can apply the Aa() or Ab() production repeatedly until the lookahead symbol is not an a.

B(): This function generates the set of strings that have an equal number of a's and b's, and start with one or more b's. We can apply the Ba() or Bb() production repeatedly until the lookahead symbol is not a b.

Aa(): This function generates the set of strings that have one more a than b, and can be used to replace an a in the first part of a string. We can check that the lookahead symbol is an a, consume it, and then recursively call the A() function.

Ab(): This function generates the set of strings that have one more b than a, and can be used to replace an a in the first part of a string. We can check that the lookahead symbol is a b, consume it, and then recursively call the A() function.

Ba(): This function generates the set of strings that have one more a than b, and can be used to replace a b in the first part of a string. We can check that the lookahead symbol is an a, consume it, and then recursively call the B() function.

Bb(): This function generates the set of strings that have one more b than a, and can be used to replace a b in the first part of a string. We can check that the lookahead symbol is a b, consume it, and then recursively call the B() function.

Note that to avoid left-recursion, we can rewrite the grammar G into an equivalent grammar G' by replacing the X → ε production with X → aXA|bXB. The resulting grammar G' has the same language as G and can be parsed using a recursive-descent parser with similar functions as described above.
