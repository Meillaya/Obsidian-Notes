# 01 Different Derivations (Lab)

Consider again grammar `G₀`. Give two _different_ derivations of `Dave runs`.

First derivation:

S → NP VP
→PN VP
→Dave V
→Dave runs

Second derivation:
S →NP VP
→PN VP
→PN V
→PN runs
→Dave runs

# 02 Equivalent Languages (Lab)

Let `G₂' = (T, N, P, S)` with `T = {a}`, `N = {S}` productions `P`:

```
S → ε
S → Sa
```

Prove that `L(G₂') = {aⁿ | n ≥ 0}`, which is the same as `L(G₂)` from the course notes.

We prove this formally by inclusion in both directions. By definition of `L(G₂)`,

```
{χ ∈ T* | S ⇒ᐩ χ} ⊆ {aⁿ | n ≥ 0}
```

means that for every `χ ∈ T*` that is derivable from `S` there exists an `n ≥ 0` such that `χ = aⁿ`. We show this by induction over the length of derivations.

-   _Base._ Suppose `χ` is derived directly from `S` by `S ⇒ χ`, which leaves only `χ = ε` according to the first production. Then `χ = a⁰`.
-   _Step._ Suppose `χ` is derived from `S` in multiple steps, which leaves only `S ⇒ Sa ⇒* χ` according to the second production. Then `χ` must be `ωa` to be derivable from `Sa`. As the derivation `S ⇒* ω` is shorter than the derivation of `S ⇒* χ`, by induction assumption there exists an `n` such that `ω = aⁿ`. Therefore `χ = ωa = aⁿa = aⁿ⁺¹`.

The inclusion in the other direction means that every `aⁿ` for `n ≥ 0` can be derived from `S`:

```
{aⁿ | n ≥ 0} ⊆ {χ ∈ T* | S ⇒ᐩ χ}
```

We show this by induction over `n`.

-   _Base._ obviously `a⁰ = ε` can be generated by the first production, `S ⇒ᐩ ε`.
-   _Step._ Suppose `aⁿ` can be generated, `S ⇒ᐩ aⁿ`. We need to show that `aⁿ⁺¹` can be generated as well. This follows from `S ⇒ Sa ⇒ᐩ aⁿa = aⁿ⁺¹`.

Thus, we can conclude `L(G₂)' = {aⁿ | n ≥ 0}`.

# 04 Ambiguity in English (Lab)

A well-known syntactically ambiguous English sentence is `Time flies like an arrow`. Explain the ambiguity!

[ Time flies ] like [an arrow], i.e the species of time flies happen to like an arrow or

TIme [flies [like [an arrow]]], i.e time flies figurateively very fast like an arrorw.

First interpretation does not semantically make sense.


# 05 Extending English Grammar (Lab)

Define a new grammar `G₀'` by extending `G₀`:

-   A verb phrase is a verb phrase followed by a prepositional phrase.
-   A prepositional phrase is a preposition followed by a noun phrase.
-   Prepositions are `in` and `on`.
-   Nouns are `park` and `child`.

Give the full definition of `G₀'`! Is `G₀'` regular, context-free, or context-sensitive? Draw the parse tree of `the child eats a banana in the park`! Use [draw.io](https://draw.io) or a similar program to generate an SVG figure and insert that in the cell below. 

𝐺′0=(𝑇,𝑁,𝑃,𝑆)

𝑇

= (Kevin, Dave, a, the, banana, apple, eats, runs, park, child, in, on)

𝑁=𝑆,𝑁𝑃,𝑉𝑃,𝑃𝑃,𝑃𝑁,𝐷,𝑁,𝑉,𝑃

Grammar Definition:

S →NP VP
NP →PN
NP →D N
VP →V
VP →VP NP
VP →VP PP
PP →P NP
PN →Kevin
PN →Dave
D →a
D →the
P →in
P →on
N →banana
N →apple

N →child
V →eats

𝐺′0 is not regular, but it is context-free.

Derivation:

# 06 Generated Language aⁿbcⁿ (Lab)

Prove formally that `L(G₃) = {aⁿbcⁿ | n ≥ 0}`! [8 points]

We prove this formally by inclusion in both directions. By definition of $L\left(G_3\right)$.

$$
\left\{\chi \in T^* \mid S \Rightarrow^{+} \chi\right\} \subseteq\left\{a^nbc^n \mid n \geq \theta\right\}
$$

means that for every $\chi \in T^*$ that is derivable from $S$ there exists an $n \geq 0$ such that $\chi=a^nbc^n$. We show this by induction over the length of derivations.

- Base. Suppose $\chi$ is derived directly from $S$ by $S \Rightarrow \chi$, which leaves only $b\varepsilon = b$ according to the first production. Then $\chi=a^nbc^n{\circ}$.
- Step. Suppose $\chi$ is derived from $S$ in multiple steps, which leaves only $S \Rightarrow S abc \Rightarrow^* \chi$ according to the second production. Then $\chi$ must be $wabc$ to be derivable from $Sabc$. As the derivation $S \Rightarrow^* w$ is shorter than the derivation of $S \Rightarrow^* \chi$, by induction assumption there exists an $n$ such that $w=a^nbc^n$. Therefore $\chi=w a=a^nbc^n =a^{n+1}bc^{n+1}$.

The inclusion in the other direction means that every $a^nbc^n$ for $n \geq 0$ can be derived from $S$ :
$$
\left\{a^nbc^n \mid n \geq \theta\right\} \subseteq\left\{\chi \in T^* \mid S \Rightarrow^{+} \chi\right\}
$$

We show this by induction over $n$.

- Base, obviously $a^{\circ}bc^{\circ}=\varepsilon$ can be generated by the first production, ${a^{+}bc^{+}} \varepsilon$.
- Step. Suppose $a^nbc^n$ can be generated, $S \Rightarrow^{+} a^nbc^n$. We need to show that $a^{n+1}bc^{n+1}$ can be generated as well. This follows from $S \Rightarrow S a \Rightarrow^{+} a^nbc^n a=a^{n+1}bc^{n+1}$.

Thus we can conclude $L\left(G_3\right)^{\prime}=\left\{a^nbc^n \mid n \geq \theta\right\}$.
