The first two `re.sub()` calls translate the nested bold and italic tags as before.

The next three `re.sub()` calls handle cases where there are unintentional nested tags, as in the second test case. In the first call, we replace the opening tag with a unique placeholder (`TEMPASTERISK`). In the second call, we replace the closing tag with the correct tag (`</em>` in this case), but only if the tag isn't already nested inside another set of tags. We use negative lookarounds to ensure that the `*` characters aren't immediately preceded or followed by another `*` character. Finally, we replace the placeholder with the closing tag.

The last two `re.sub()` calls handle cases where there are intentional nested tags, but the formatting is in the wrong order (as in the third test case). We handle nested italic tags first, and then nested bold tags. We use the same negative lookarounds as before to ensure that we're not matching already-nested tags.
