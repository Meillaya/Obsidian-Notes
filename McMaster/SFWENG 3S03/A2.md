Q3

This is a Java method named `patternIndex` that takes two String parameters `subject` and `pattern` and returns an integer index of the first occurrence of `pattern` in `subject` or -1 if `pattern` is not found in `subject`.

The method first initializes a constant variable `NOTFOUND` to -1 and two integer variables `iSub` and `rtnIndex` to 0 and `NOTFOUND`, respectively. A boolean variable `isPat` is initialized to false. The lengths of `subject` and `pattern` are also calculated and stored in `subjectLen` and `patternLen`.

A while loop is then used to iterate through `subject` to search for `pattern`. The loop continues as long as `isPat` is false and the end of `subject` has not been reached.

Within the loop, an if statement checks if the current character of `subject` at index `iSub` matches the first character of `pattern`. If there is a match, the index of the current character `iSub` is stored in `rtnIndex`, `isPat` is set to true, and a for loop is used to check if the remaining characters of `pattern` match the characters of `subject` starting from `iSub + 1`. If a mismatch is found, `rtnIndex` is reset to `NOTFOUND`, `isPat` is set to false, and the for loop is exited using a break statement.

Finally, the method returns `rtnIndex`, which contains the index of the first occurrence of `pattern` in `subject`, or `-1` if `pattern` is not found in `subject`.

The method throws a `NullPointerException` if either `subject` or `pattern` is null.


Defs:

-   `NOTFOUND`: a constant variable that stores the value -1
-   `iSub`: an integer variable that is initialized to 0 and used to keep track of the current index in `subject` during the while loop
-   `rtnIndex`: an integer variable that is initialized to `NOTFOUND` and used to store the index of the first occurrence of `pattern` in `subject`
-   `isPat`: a boolean variable that is initialized to false and used to keep track of whether the `pattern` has been found in `subject`
-   `subjectLen`: an integer variable that stores the length of the `subject` string
-   `patternLen`: an integer variable that stores the length of the `pattern` string

Uses:

-   `subject`: a parameter of type `String` that represents the string to search
-   `pattern`: a parameter of type `String` that represents the pattern to find
-   `length()`: a method of the `String` class that is used to calculate the length of `subject` and `pattern`
-   `charAt()`: a method of the `String` class that is used to access individual characters of `subject` and `pattern`
-   == operator: used to check if the current character of `subject` at index `iSub` matches the first character of `pattern`
-   `++` operator: used to increment the `iPat` variable in the for loop
-   `return`: used to return the index of the first occurrence of `pattern` in `subject` or `-1` if `pattern` is not found in `subject`
-   `NullPointerException`: an exception that is thrown if either `subject` or `pattern` is null
