Q3

This is a Java method named `patternIndex` that takes two String parameters `subject` and `pattern` and returns an integer index of the first occurrence of `pattern` in `subject` or -1 if `pattern` is not found in `subject`.

The method first initializes a constant variable `NOTFOUND` to -1 and two integer variables `iSub` and `rtnIndex` to 0 and `NOTFOUND`, respectively. A boolean variable `isPat` is initialized to false. The lengths of `subject` and `pattern` are also calculated and stored in `subjectLen` and `patternLen`.

A while loop is then used to iterate through `subject` to search for `pattern`. The loop continues as long as `isPat` is false and the end of `subject` has not been reached.

Within the loop, an if statement checks if the current character of `subject` at index `iSub` matches the first character of `pattern`. If there is a match, the index of the current character `iSub` is stored in `rtnIndex`, `isPat` is set to true, and a for loop is used to check if the remaining characters of `pattern` match the characters of `subject` starting from `iSub + 1`. If a mismatch is found, `rtnIndex` is reset to `NOTFOUND`, `isPat` is set to false, and the for loop is exited using a break statement.

Finally, the method returns `rtnIndex`, which contains the index of the first occurrence of `pattern` in `subject`, or `-1` if `pattern` is not found in `subject`.

The method throws a `NullPointerException` if either `subject` or `pattern` is null.

Defs:

-   `NOTFOUND`: a constant variable that stores the value -1
-   `iSub`: an integer variable that is initialized to 0 and used to keep track of the current index in `subject` during the while loop
-   `rtnIndex`: an integer variable that is initialized to `NOTFOUND` and used to store the index of the first occurrence of `pattern` in `subject`
-   `isPat`: a boolean variable that is initialized to false and used to keep track of whether the `pattern` has been found in `subject`
-   `subjectLen`: an integer variable that stores the length of the `subject` string
-   `patternLen`: an integer variable that stores the length of the `pattern` string

Uses:

-   `subject`: a parameter of type `String` that represents the string to search
-   `pattern`: a parameter of type `String` that represents the pattern to find
-   `length()`: a method of the `String` class that is used to calculate the length of `subject` and `pattern`
-   `charAt()`: a method of the `String` class that is used to access individual characters of `subject` and `pattern`
-   == operator: used to check if the current character of `subject` at index `iSub` matches the first character of `pattern`
-   `++` operator: used to increment the `iPat` variable in the for loop
-   `return`: used to return the index of the first occurrence of `pattern` in `subject` or `-1` if `pattern` is not found in `subject`
-   `NullPointerException`: an exception that is thrown if either `subject` or `pattern` is null

Within the while loop, there are two paths that lead to the end of the loop:

-   Path B: The pattern is found in the subject string
-   Path C: The end of the subject string is reached and the pattern is not found.

At the end of the while loop, the method returns the value of `rtnIndex`, which is either the index of the first occurrence of the pattern in the subject string (Path B) or -1 if the pattern is not found (Path C).

Here are the unique du-paths in the program:

1.  `subject` def in Start -> `subject` use in Check for null -> `subject` use in Continue -> `subject` use in While Loop
2.  `pattern` def in Start -> `pattern` use in Check for null -> `pattern` use in Continue -> `pattern` use in While Loop
3.  `subject` def in Continue -> `subjectLen` def in Continue -> `subjectLen` use in Continue -> `subjectLen` use in While Loop
4.  `pattern` def in Continue -> `patternLen` def in Continue -> `patternLen` use in Continue -> `patternLen` use in While Loop
5.  `iSub` def in Continue -> `iSub` use in While Loop
6.  `rtnIndex` def in Continue -> `rtnIndex` use in Return -1
7.  `NOTFOUND` def in Continue -> `NOTFOUND` use in While Loop -> `NOTFOUND` use in While Loop -> `NOTFOUND` use in Return -1
8.  `isPat` def in Continue -> `isPat` use in While Loop -> `isPat` use in While Loop

Note that there are multiple paths that start with the same def node (e.g., path 1 and path 3 both start with `subject` def in Start), but they are considered separate paths because they end with different use nodes. Similarly, there are multiple paths that end with the same use node (e.g., path 6 and path 7 both end with `rtnIndex` use in Return -1), but they are considered separate paths because they start with different def nodes.

To cover all the du-paths in this program, we would need at least 8 tests. This is because there are 8 unique du-paths in the program, as determined in the previous question. Each test case would need to be designed to exercise one of the unique du-paths in the program, in order to ensure that all the defs and uses are covered by the tests.

Note that this is the minimum number of tests required to cover all the du-paths in the program, and additional tests may be needed to achieve higher levels of coverage (e.g., branch coverage or statement coverage).
