# Question 1

Three functional tests for this program are as follows:

**Test 1:**

Check for valid user input. This test will verify that the user inputs calculate the correct amount for the car insurance payment according to the formula used to calculate the customer's car insurance payments. The test will fail if the program fails to compile or returns a null/empty value or returns an incorrect car insurance payment value.

Example pseudocode:

```python
def carInsurance()

age, yDriving, claimAmts = 0
postalCode = ''
payment = 0

try:
//formula to calculate insurance


except Exception:
	print("Incorrect value or null return val. Check input")
	sys.exit(1)

return 0
```

**Test 2:**

Check for invalid input. This test will verify that the program can correctly handle negative inputs or invalid input types. The expected output in such cases will be an error message or thrown exception.

Example pseudocode:
