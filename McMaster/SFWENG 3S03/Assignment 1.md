1.  Test Automation: Implementing a robust test automation strategy can help the company to achieve a high level of testing maturity. Automated tests can be executed quickly and accurately, reducing the time and effort required for manual testing. This allows the company to focus on more important tasks, such as designing and developing high-quality software.
    
2.  Cultural Shift: Changing the company's culture to embrace testing as a critical part of the software development process is critical. This requires creating a culture of continuous improvement and a focus on software quality. Teams must be encouraged to take ownership of the software's quality, and testing must be integrated into the development process from the beginning.
    
3.  Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implementing a CI/CD pipeline can help the company to quickly identify and resolve software defects. This process integrates testing into the development workflow, allowing the company to detect and fix bugs early in the development cycle, reducing the cost and time required to fix them later.
    
4.  Test Data Management: To achieve a high level of testing maturity, it is important to have a well-defined test data management strategy. This involves creating a centralized repository for test data and managing it effectively. This can help to ensure that tests are repeatable, reliable, and consistent.
    
5.  Test Metrics and Analytics: Measuring and analyzing testing metrics can help the company to determine the effectiveness of their testing practices. This can include metrics such as test coverage, test execution time, and the number of bugs found. By analyzing these metrics, the company can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to improve the software's quality.

1.  Test-Driven Development (TDD): Adopting TDD, where tests are written before code, can help ensure that testing is integrated into the software development process from the start. This approach encourages developers to think about the behavior of the software and design it to be testable.
    
2.  Automated Testing: Automated testing helps to remove human error, reduce the time and effort required to run tests, and increase the consistency and repeatability of tests. The use of automated testing tools can also provide quicker feedback on code changes, making it easier to identify and resolve issues before they become larger problems.
    
3.  Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): The use of CI/CD can help ensure that tests are run every time code changes are made, reducing the risk of regressions and increasing the confidence that code changes are safe. This can also help to identify issues early in the development process and allow for more frequent releases of working software.
    
4.  Test Coverage: Ensuring that tests cover a wide range of scenarios and conditions can help to identify potential issues and improve the overall quality of the software. A focus on test coverage can also help to encourage developers to think more broadly about the potential impact of their code changes.
    
5.  Collaboration: Encouraging collaboration between development and testing teams can help to ensure that testing is integrated into the development process and that both teams understand the importance of testing in delivering high-quality software. This can also help to foster a culture of quality, where testing is seen as an integral part of the software development process.

```java
import java.util.Vector;

public class VectorUtils {
    public static Vector<Integer> difference(Vector<Integer> a, Vector<Integer> b) {
        Vector<Integer> result = new Vector<>();
        for (Integer item : a) {
            if (!b.contains(item)) {
                result.add(item);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

1.  The definition of "element" is not clear. Are we considering the elements to be primitive values or objects?
    
2.  It is not specified whether the input vectors can contain duplicates or not.
    
3.  It is not specified whether the input vectors can be empty or not. If so, what should be the output in that case?
    
4.  It is not specified whether the input vectors are sorted or not. If they are not sorted, what should be the order of elements in the output vector?
    
5.  The definition of "not also elements of b" is vague. Does this mean that if an element is present multiple times in `a` and `b`, it should be included in the output vector only once, or should it be included multiple times?


## Q4
Here are ten interesting test cases for the "save to file" functionality of MS Word in pseudocode:

1.  Test saving a new document with different file formats (e.g. .docx, .pdf, .rtf)
    
    -   TestCase 1:
        -   Open a new Word document
        -   Enter some text
        -   Save the document as .docx format
        -   Check if the file was saved successfully
2.  Test saving a document with different character encodings (e.g. UTF-8, UTF-16)
    
    -   TestCase 2:
        -   Open a new Word document
        -   Enter some text with special characters
        -   Save the document with UTF-8 encoding
        -   Check if the special characters are displayed correctly after opening the file
3.  Test saving a document with password protection
    
    -   TestCase 3:
        -   Open a new Word document
        -   Enter some text
