The use of your course notes and formulas (one double-sided page), [Study Guide](https://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/os-book/OS10/study-guide/Study-Guide.pdf "Study Guide") (to Accompany Operating Systems Concepts, 10th Ed), and the textbook is **permitted** during this exam, but you are **not allowed to bring questions with solutions**. The only electronic device you can use is the McMaster Standard Calculator Casio FX-991 MS or MS Plus.

Please review your **midterm exam,** **homework assignments**, and **the questions presented in the tutorials**. The best additional exercise would be to go through **practice questions from the textbook**, especially those questions that require numerical calculation.

Good Luck!

You can bring to the exam the following:

1) Hard copy of Study Guide ([https://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/os-book/OS10/study-guide/Study-Guide.pdf](https://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/os-book/OS10/study-guide/Study-Guide.pdf)) Ch1- Ch12

2) Hard copy of the textbook (Abraham Silberschatz, Greg Gagne, Peter B. Galvin — Operating System Concepts, **10th Edition**)

3) Crib sheet (double-sided) containing your notes and formulas

You can have all three, but **Study Guide** from chapter 1 to chapter 12 (15 pages) is basically all you need.

The **only electronic device** you can use is the **McMaster Standard Calculator Casio FX-991** MS or MS Plus. (no laptops, tablets, mobile phones, etc.)
